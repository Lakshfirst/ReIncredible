<img src="https://statueofunity.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/PM-approve-image-300x278.png"style="padding-left:30px;" width="250px" height="200px">
<p style="color:#6F8FAF;">“India has got a rich cultural heritage of “Unity in Diversity”, the roots of which are inextricably founded on the principle of “Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam”, meaning that the entire universe is a family.</p>
<p style="color:#6F8FAF;"> At the time of India’s independence in 1947, it was however divided into more than 560 princely states and it was India’s first Deputy Prime Minister, Bharat Ratna Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who with his firm determination, could transform such imperialism into today’s unified India. People of India will remain indebted to him forever for his leadership during the freedom struggle and his vision, wisdom and statesmanship in the post-independence era. His life is an eternal source of inspiration for the present as well as future generations and it is in this context that his iconic monumental statue – the world’s tallest Statue of Unity has been dedicated to the Nation on the 143rd Birth Anniversary.</p>
<p style="color:#6F8FAF;">Symbolizing the national, spiritual, historical and academic values, the Statue of Unity will lead to the icon-based development of this entire region, which is predominantly a tribal area. Our vision is to make this place a world class tourist destination by providing infrastructure for edutainment, research, cultural, environmental enrichment and health promotion. A true leader keeps on enlightening the path of mankind even in his physical absence and the Statue of Unity is the realization of this – worth experiencing.</p>

<h1 style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;text-align:center;color:white;text-shadow:4px 4px 4px yellow;"> A TESTIMONIAL OF INDIA'S SPIRIT OF UNITY IN DIVERSITY

<p style="color:white;font-family:Impact;">Since time immemorial, architecture and monuments have given India her identity. From historical Ajanta & Ellora caves to Delwara Temple of Mount Abu and from Taj Mahal to Meenakshi Temple of Madurai, Indian architecture showcases its elegance and superiority across the globe. The most prolific creation in recent times, the Statue of Unity, is the World’s Tallest Monument. It represents more than a colossal structure facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the river Narmada. It is an iconic symbol of the ‘Iron Man’, who played an important role during India’s freedom struggle and thereafter in the unification of the princely states. It reminds the world of the towering personality of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the nucleus of India’s integration as a united country.</p>\
<p style="color:white;font-family:Impact;">It was the wit and whip of this ‘Iron Man’ that 562 small and big princely states unanimously agreed to become an integral part of India. The elucidation of the Statue directly correlates with the meaning and value of unity. While, it is one of the finest interpretations of the designers with its modern construal, it also symbolises and describes the quintessence of the statue to visitors. The world’s tallest statue is an engineering marvel that was constructed in merely 46 months.</p>
<p style="color:white;font-family:Impact;">Sardar Patel, respected for his commitment and drive, took up the challenge of convincing all the princely states using diplomacy and peaceful means, or the iron hand when needed.</p>
<p style="color:white;font-family:Impact;">The impressive landmark commemorating Sardar Patel’s contribution to unification dovetails into several social development programmes such as improved transport and connectivity, institutions of research, education and tribal development, tourist facilities and other social infrastructure.</p>
